# Important notices

Nuker will pick a cardinal direction based on your facing dir when turning it on

Nuker will ONLY use light-blue shulkers for pickaxes (you can change that and recompile lol)

Recommended to cap your fps at like 20

Nuker will disconnect on:
- no food
- no totems
- some other dangerous conditions i dont remember check the code
  

## Recommended setup
Slot 1 - junk blocks (e.g. netherrack) - for filling/scaffolding
Slot 2 - Pickaxe
Slot 3 - food
Slot 4 - food/pickaxe shulker
Slot 5 - food/pickaxe shulker
Slots 6-9 - pickaxe shulkers
Offhand - totem

in the inventory, put all non-pickaxe shulkers in the bottom right of the inner inventory (not on the hotbar) as those have the last IDs.

# Building - very important
I recommend you build this YOURSELF. I will not be providing support or development here so you're on your own if something is wrong.

Most of the highwaytools' code is in NukerModule.java.

If there's anything missing in this readme lmk i'll update it.
